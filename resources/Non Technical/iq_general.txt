
Interview Questions - General Questions
=======================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Q. What are your strengths ans weaknesses?
A. General (for weakness): 
    Highlight a skill that you wish to improve upon and describe what you
    are doing to enhance your skill in this area.
    Stay away from personal qualities and concentrate on professional
    traits.
    State only one weekness.
    Try to point out a couple of weaknesses that the interviewer might see
    as strengths, such as sometimes being a little too meticulous about the
    quality of your work. (Avoid saying "I work too hard." It's a
    predictable, common answer.) For every weakness, offer a strength that
    compensates for it.

   Strengths (tailor for position offered):
    - Allways keep up with new technology and have worked on complex systems.
    - I am working very methodicly.
    - I work fast and complete tasks quickly (don't waste time).
    - Have successfully worked in different environments (.com and banks).
    - Have worked in development and production environments.
    - Have worked with the complete toolset of Oracle over several years.

   Weaknesses:
    - I have worked for Unix for a long time and know it very well, but I
      want to improve on my Unix adminstrator skills. Some positions need
      the DBA to do Unix administration. I currently have Linux running at
      home to be able to improve my skills. New techology (web, storrage)
      makes it neccessary to have more admin like Unix skills.

    - I have worked with Oracle most of the time. I want increase my
      non-Oracle knowledge. I recently installed SQLServer at home to fresh
      up my knowledge of it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Q. Why should we hire you?
A. General:
    Summarize your experiences.
    Because of your knowledge, experience, abilities and skills.
    Point out your positive attributes related to the job, and the good job
    you've done in the past. Include any compliments you've received from
    management.


    - You are looking for a Oracle DBA that ... I am a very good match to
      your requirements, because ...
    - Knowledge of newest technology.
    - Used to work under pressure.
    - Have successfully worked in different environments (.com and banks).
    - Have always been successful at the places I have worked.

    Well, this is the key question! In your job description you clearly
    state that you are looking for someone who is… and who can do… Is that
    an accurate description? 

    You can then conclude by saying: 
    I definitely believe I have the skills and qualities you are looking
    for to be a success in this job. I'm a team player. I listen and am
    more than willing to learn from my superiors and I have the desire to
    do very well. 
    Is there anything that I have left out that you would like me to expand
    on? 

    With eleven years' experience working as Oracle DBA and developer in
    the financial and other leading industries and my proven record of
    successfully completing projects, I'm confident I would be a great
    addition to your team. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Q. How would you rate yourself on a scale of 1-to-10?

A. Well, that is a good question. How would I rate myself? 
   I can only assume that you are referring to my ability to do the job so
   I have to say that I am quite confident about that and would rate myself
   edging well up to the seven or eight mark. 
   However, there is always scope for improvement and I always try to
   improve from other experienced and skilled people or by reading and so
   on.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Q. Do you have any questions?
A. 
   Ask the interviewer why he joined the company and if he could tell you
   what challenges and opportunities keep him here.
  
    - Can you tell me about your career?
    - What keeps you here at this company? Why did you join it?

    - What are your plans for the future in technology? Are you plan to use
      any of the new Oracle technologies like RAC, 10g, ...?
    - How does a typical day for this role look? Are there regular team
      meetings?
    - Where is the job located? 
    - What might my first assignment be? 
    - Are there training programs available for staff members and how long
      before one can apply for them?
    - What is the longterm strategy of the company?
    - How is the dress code?
    - Is there a lot of weekend and out of hours work?

    - You could ask them if they have any concerns or reservations on 
      what has been discussed or your ability to do the job.

    I have some quesionts to the interview and it's progression:
    - How many other candidates do you interview?
    - In what timescales are you going to make your decission?

    Yes, I do. From what you've been asking during the interview, it sounds
    like you have a problem with customer retention. Can you tell me a
    little more about the current situation, and what the first challenges
    would be for the new person?" 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Q. Why Do You Want to Work for us? 
A. General:
    The interviewer is listening for an answer that indicates you've given
    this some thought and are not sending out resumes just because there is
    an opening. For example, "I've selected key companies whose mission
    statements are in line with my values, where I know I could be excited
    about what the company does, and this company is very high on my list
    of desirable choices." 

    Don't talk about what you want; first, talk about their needs: You
    would like to be part of a specific company project; you would like to
    solve a company problem; you can make a definite contribution to
    specific company goals.  

    Avoid the predictable, such as, "Because it's a great company." Say why
    you think it's a great company.

    - I have selected companies of the finance industrie.
    - I want to work for companies where I can get excited about what the
      company does and the work.
    - I want to work with new technologies in an challanging environment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Q. What about the job offered do you find the most attractive? Least
   attractive? 
A. General:
    List three or more attractive factors and only one minor unattractive
    factor.  

    Most attractive:
        - Interesting projects, new technologies used.
        - Leading player in the finance industrie (of it's industrie sector).
        - Location (e.g. City).

    Least attractive:
        - It's only a minor point, but as you have asked for it, the ....
          could be better ...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Q. What Are Your Goals? 
Q. Where do you see yourself five (ten or fifteen) years from now?

A. General:
    Sometimes it's best to talk about short-term and intermediate goals
    rather than locking yourself into the distant future. 
    
    Explain your career-advancement goals that are in line with the job for
    which you are interviewing. Your interviewer is likely more interested
    in how he, she or the company will benefit from you achieving your
    goals than what you'll get from it, but it goes hand in hand to a large
    degree. It's not a good idea to tell your potential new boss that
    you'll be going after his or her job, but it's okay to mention that
    you'd like to earn a senior or management position.

    - My immediate goal is to get a job in a growth-oriented company. My
      long-term goal will depend on where the company goes. I hope to
      eventually grow into a position of responsibility. 
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Q. Why Did You Leave (Or Why Are You Leaving) Your Job? 
A. 
    If you're unemployed, state your reason for leaving in a positive
    context: "I managed to survive two rounds of corporate downsizing, but
    the third round was a 20 percent reduction in the workforce, which
    included me." 

    If you are employed, focus on what you want in your next job: "After
    two years, I made the decision to look for a company that is
    team-focused, where I can add my experience." 

    - Contract/project came to an end.
    - Permanent DBA was hired for my replacement.
    - IT gets outsourced to ... / offshored to ...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Q. When Were You Most Satisfied in Your Job? 
A. 
    The interviewer wants to know what motivates you. If you can relate an
    example of a job or project when you were excited, the interviewer will
    get an idea of your preferences. "I was very satisfied in my last job,
    because I worked directly with the customers and their problems; that
    is an important part of the job for me." 

    - At Tesco I was working on a 2TB database using EMC SAN storrage. I
      haven't worked on this size of database before and it was very
      exciting and I could learn a lot.
      
    - At Tesco I worked on the UBSM (unit based stock managment) project. I
      joined the project early on and therefor could see it through from
      the beginning to completion. I found this very satisfying.

    - At Credit Suisse I upgraded a 3-way Oracle streams system after 2
      months in the job. This was withour prior streams experiance. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Q. What Can You Do for Us That Other Candidates Can't? 
A. 
    What makes you unique? This will take an assessment of your
    experiences, skills and traits. Summarize concisely: "I have a unique
    combination of strong technical skills, and the ability to build strong
    customer relationships. This allows me to use my knowledge and break
    down information to be more user-friendly." 

    Relate past experiences that show you've had success in solving
    previous employer problem(s) that may be similar to those of the
    prospective employer.  

    - Wide range Oracle skills as DBA and Developer.
    - Have used the complete Oracle toolset.
    - Have experience with key technology: RAC, very big databases (2TB),
      EMC SAN storrage

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Q. What Are Three Positive Things Your Last Boss Would Say About You? 
A. 
    It's time to pull out your old performance appraisals and boss's
    quotes.  This is a great way to brag about yourself through someone
    else's words: "My boss has told me that I am the best designer he has
    ever had. He knows he can rely on me, and he likes my sense of humor." 

    - He will say, that I am doing my job without much guidance. He doesn't
      need to tell me what to do, I just get on with doing the job.
    - That he can rely on me getting the job done.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Q. What Salary Are You Seeking? 
A. General: 
    It is to your advantage if the employer tells you the range first.
    Prepare by knowing the going rate in your area, and your bottom line or
    walk-away point.
    
    - I am sure when the time comes, we can agree on a reasonable amount.
    - I am currently on £x and I am willing to listen to any reasonable
      offer.
    - In what range do you typically pay someone with my background?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Q. How long would it take you to make a meaningful contribution to our firm? 
A. 
   - Not long at all. I expect only a brief period of adjustment to the new
     environment after which I should be productive very soon. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Q. How long would you stay with us? 
A. 
   - As long as the contract gets renewed.
   - As long as we both feel I'm contributing, achieving, growing, etc. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Q. Which adjectives would you use to describe yourself?
A. 
    Answer with positive, work-oriented adjectives, such as conscientious,
    hard-working, honest and courteous, plus a brief description or example
    of why each fits you well.

    - hard-working
    - honest

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Q. What type of work environment do you like best?
A.  
    Tailor your answer to the job. For example, if in doing your job you're
    required to lock the lab doors and work alone, then indicate that you
    enjoy being a team player when needed, but also enjoy working
    independently. If you're required to attend regular project planning
    and status meetings, then indicate that you're a strong team player and
    like being part of a team.

    For working alone:
        - I enjoy being a team player but also enjoy working independently.

    For working in a team:
        - I am a strong team player, it gives me inspiration and you can
          learn from each other in a team.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Q. How do you handle pressure and stress?
A. 
    This is sort of a double whammy, because you're likely already stressed
    from the interview and the interviewer can see if you're handling it
    well or not. Everybody feels stress, but the degree varies. Saying that
    you whine to your shrink, kick your dog or slam down a fifth of Jack
    Daniels are not good answers. Exercising, relaxing with a good book,
    socializing with friends or turning stress into productive energy are
    more along the lines of the "correct" answers.

    I think it helps when you can switch of from work when you are not in
    the office. I do this by:
    - Go to play rugby at weekends.
    - Go for a night out with friends.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Q. Explain how you overcame a major obstacle.
A. 
    The interviewer is likely looking for a particular example of your
    problem-solving skills and the pride you show for solving it.

    Oracle Reports Server:
        - Had no experience when I did it the first time.
        - Used Oracle documentation, metalink, Google to find solutions.
        - Had to make many configuration changes and patch istalls but got
          it working in the end.

    Oracle Streams:
        - Had no experience when I started and was in charge of a critical
          3-way streams system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Q. You have a lot of experience. Explain how this can be usefull.
A.
