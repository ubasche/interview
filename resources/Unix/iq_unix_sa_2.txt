==========================

User
These questions will demonstrate whether the supplicant has had exposure to

Basic (generic) Administration
These questions test whether the supplicant has done basic UNIX System
Administration. Some questions (fsck) may not apply if the system architecture
does not have an analogous construct (AIX). Sophistocated Help Desk personnel
should be able to answer all of these. Since they all deal with day-to-day
administration.

- How can I copy a file from one system to another? ftp,rcp
- What command lets me remotely log into another system? telnet,rsh
- Give an example of a domain name? dcicorp.com, ford.com
- Give an example of a host name? varies widely

Networking Administration
These questions test whether the supplicant has done basic network
administration. Note, this doesn't mean that he may not know some networking
tools (FTP,rcp, etc..) but has he set them up before, does he know how they
work?

- What is an IP address? 32-bit Internet Protocol ID Number

- What is SMTP? Simple Mail Transport Protocol
- What is traceroute? IP routing utility
- How does traceroute work? declining TTL in IP header

Security
For those people that put "security" down, these two questions should be quite
easy for UNIX "security" people.

- What are shadow passwords? unreadable password files
- What is an rhosts file? Why is it bad? Bezerkley trust, can be abused
- Why are set-uid shell scripts a bad idea? unexpected shell expansion 
- What is SSH? Secure Shell 
- Explain (briefly) Kerberos? Ticket-based scheme for authentication 
- What is the problem with running fingerd(1)? Gratuituous information
- Sendmail is currently at what version? 8.x. If they don't use sendmail, hooray
- Who is CERT? What do they do? Computer Emergency Response Team, issue advisories

Perl
These indicate whether or not a person really has seen perl scripts before.
Perl scripts can be easy to read, but if you write them, these questions are
easy. Use the perl examination for further testing here.
