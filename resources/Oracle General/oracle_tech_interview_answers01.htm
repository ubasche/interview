<p>The interview process can be quite stressful. Here is the first
part of a two part series on helping you answer those tough questions that you
might experience in your quest for an Oracle DBA position.</p>



<p>Ever
since I wrote the past article on the Oracle Technical Interview, I have been
bombarded with e-mails asking for help on getting through the interview
questions that I presented. Most of you I have answered, others I was reluctant
to post all of the answers so that you could begin your own quest for the
answers. Now, however, I have decided to post the answers knowing that we can
all benefit from them. If there are any questions here that you still need
clarification on, please e-mail me and I will do my best to further explain the
answer I have given. Please remember that as you go through the article, it is
not enough to know the answer to a particular question, you must try and put
yourself in an interview situation and experience answering the question for
yourself. Therefore, after you have gone through the questions and answers read
the question yourself and then answer it with your own words. As always, good
luck, and cheers.</p>

<h3>Personal</h3>

<p>This part of the interview question is not to be regarded as
insignificant. If the interviewer asks you these questions take it as a sign
that they are interested in you, your qualities, and how you interact with
people throughout the day. Take it as an opportunity to prove that you have
been around the block a few times, are willing to work with other people, and
enjoy the job you do. Many times people see DBA types as stuffy and pointed,
not willing to work with others, and only concerned with the database and its day-to-day
operational needs. Put aside the needs of the database and talk about how you
work with people and the different departments in the organization and are
concerned with providing them with top notch database services.</p>

<div style="margin: 20px;"><p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</strong><strong>What
DBA activities did you to do today? </strong></p>

<p>Wow, this is a loaded question and almost begs for you to
answer it with &quot;What DBA activities do you LIKE to do on a daily basis?.&quot;
 And that is how I would answer this question. Again, do not get caught up in
the &quot;typical&quot; day-to-day operational issues of database
administration. Sure, you can talk about the index you rebuilt, the monitoring
of system and session waits that were occurring, or the space you added to a
data file, these are all good and great and you should convey that you
understand the day-to-day operational issues. What you should also throw into
this answer are the meetings that you attend to provide direction in the
database arena, the people that you meet and talk with daily to answer adhoc
questions about database use, the modeling of business needs within the
database, and the extra time you spend early in the morning or late at night to
get the job done. Just because the question stipulates &quot;today&quot; do not
take &quot;today&quot; to mean &quot;today.&quot; Make sure you wrap up a few
good days into &quot;today&quot; and talk about them. This question also begs you
to ask the question of &quot;What typical DBA activities are performed day to
day within X Corporation?&quot;</p>

<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</strong><strong>What is
your typical day like? </strong></p>

<p>If you spend enough time on question 1, this question will
never be asked. It is really a continuation of question 1 to try and get you to
open up and talk about the type of things you like to do. Personally, I would
continue with the theme of question 1 if you are cut short or this question is asked
later in the interview process. Just note that this question is not all geared
toward the day-to-day operational issues you experience as a DBA. This question
also gives you the opportunity to see if they want to know about you as an
individual. Since the question did not stipulate &quot;on the job&quot; I would
throw in a few items like, I get up at 5:00am to get into work and get some quiet time to read up on new trends or
you help coach your son/daughter's soccer team. Just test the waters to what is
acceptable. If the interviewer starts to pull you back to &quot;job&quot;
related issues, do not go to personal. Also, if you go to the office of the
interviewer please notice the surroundings, if there are pictures of his/her
family, it is probably a good idea to venture down the personal path. If there
is a fly-fishing picture on the wall, do not say you like deep-sea fishing. You
get the picture.</p>

<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</strong><strong>What
other parts of your organization do you interact with and how? </strong></p>

<p>Again, if you have exhausted question 1 and 2 you may
never get to this question. But if you have been apprehensive to opening up and
explaining yourself, take note that you may have an issue and the interviewer
might also be already getting tired of the interview process. If you get to
this question consider yourself in trouble. You really need to forget all your
hang-ups and start explaining what it is that you like to do as a DBA, and why
you want to work for this particular company. You are going to have to reel
this interviewer back into the interview process or you might not get to the
true technical question part of the interview.</p>

<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</strong><strong>Do you
consider yourself a development DBA or a production DBA and why? </strong></p>

<p>I take this as a trick question and explain it that way.
Never in my database carrier have I distinguished between &quot;development&quot;
and &quot;production.&quot; Just ask your development staff or VP of
engineering how much time and money is lost if development systems are down.
Explain to the interviewer that both systems are equally important to the
operation of the company and both should be considered as production systems
because there are people relying on them and money is lost if either one of
them is down. Ok you may be saying, and I know you are, that we lose more money
if the production system is down. Ok, convey that to the interviewer and you won't
get anyone to disagree with you unless your company sells software or there are
million dollar deals on the table that are expecting the next release of your
product or service.</p>

<p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</strong><strong>Are you
a nuts-n-bolts DBA or a tools-n-props DBA </strong></p>

<p>This question begs for me to give definition around the
terms I basically group DBAs into. These are not good or bad groups but something
I like to think about when talking to DBAs. A nuts-n-bolts DBA is the type that
likes to figure out every little item about how the database works. He/she is a
DBA who typically hates a GUI environment and prefers the command line to
execute commands and accomplish tasks. A nuts-n-bolts DBA like to feel in
control of the database and only feels comfortable at the command line and vi
as an editor. The tools-n-props DBA is mostly the opposite of a nuts-n-bolts
DBA, they like the feel of a GUI, the ease at which things can be accomplished
without knowing much about the database. They want to get the job done with the
least amount of intervention from having to figure out what everything is doing
behind the scenes. Now the answer, I would explain myself as a combination of
the two. I, having been in this business for over 20 years, have grown up in a
command line era where the GUIs never seemed to work. There was high complexity
in systems and not much good documentation on how things worked. Thus, I had to
learn everything about most aspects of the database environment I was working
in and thus became a nuts-n-bolts DBA. I was a true command line and vi bigot.
Times have changed and the GUIs are very reliable, understand the environment
they are installed on, and can generally get the job done quicker for
individuals new to database administration. I too am slowly slipping over to
the dark side of GUI administration. If you find
yourself as a tools-n-props DBA, try to convey that you are aware of some tasks
that require you to be a nuts-n-bolts DBA. </p>

<h3>Technical – Oracle</h3>

<p>This is the part you have all been waiting on. Please if you
have just skipped to this section, go back to the personal section and read it.
There is much to be gained by the personal section and conveying to your
interviewer who you are and how you tick from day to day. Also, the answers I
am giving here are off the cuff and are not intended to be the definitive
answer to these questions. There are many aspects to these questions that just cannot
be answered here and honestly, you will not have time to explain any of these
questions fully in the interview process. It is up to you to make sure your
interviewer understands that you understand the question and have given enough
information that they know you understand the concept.</p>

<div style="margin: 20px;"><p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</strong><strong>Explain
the difference between a hot backup and a cold backup and the benefits associated
with each. </strong></p>

<p>A hot backup is basically taking a backup of the database
while it is still up and running and it must be in archive log mode. A cold
backup is taking a backup of the database while it is shut down and does not
require being in archive log mode. The benefit of taking a hot backup is that
the database is still available for use while the backup is occurring and you
can recover the database to any point in time. The benefit of taking a cold
backup is that it is typically easier to administer the backup and recovery
process. In addition, since you are taking cold backups the database does not
require being in archive log mode and thus there will be a slight performance
gain as the database is not cutting archive logs to disk.</p>

<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</strong><strong>You
have just had to restore from backup and do not have any control files. How
would you go about bringing up this database? </strong></p>

<p>I would create a text based backup control file,
stipulating where on disk all the data files where and then issue the recover command
with the using backup control file clause.</p>

<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</strong><strong>How do
you switch from an init.ora file to a spfile? </strong></p>

<p>Issue the create spfile from pfile command.</p>

<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</strong><strong>Explain
the difference between a data block, an extent and a segment. </strong></p>

<p>A data block is the smallest unit of logical storage for a
database object. As objects grow they take chunks of additional storage that
are composed of contiguous data blocks. These groupings of contiguous data
blocks are called extents. All the extents that an object takes when grouped together
are considered the segment of the database object.</p>

<p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</strong><strong>Give
two examples of how you might determine the structure of the table DEPT. </strong></p>

<p>Use the describe command or use the dbms_metadata.get_ddl
package.</p>

<p><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</strong><strong>Where
would you look for errors from the database engine? </strong></p>

<p>In the alert log.</p>

<p><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</strong><strong>Compare
and contrast TRUNCATE and DELETE for a table. </strong></p>

<p>Both the truncate and delete command have the desired
outcome of getting rid of all the rows in a table. The difference between the
two is that the truncate command is a DDL operation and just moves the high
water mark and produces a now rollback. The delete command, on the other hand,
is a DML operation, which will produce a rollback and thus take longer to
complete.</p>

<p><strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</strong><strong>Give
the reasoning behind using an index. </strong></p>

<p>Faster access to data blocks in a table.</p>

<p><strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</strong><strong>Give
the two types of tables involved in producing a star schema and the type of
data they hold. </strong></p>

<p>Fact tables and dimension tables. A fact table contains
measurements while dimension tables will contain data that will help describe
the fact tables.</p>

<p><strong>10.
</strong><strong>. What
type of index should you use on a fact table? </strong></p>

<p>A Bitmap index.</p>

<p><strong>11.
</strong><strong> Give
two examples of referential integrity constraints. </strong></p>

<p>A primary key and a foreign key.</p>

<p><strong>12.
</strong><strong>A table
is classified as a parent table and you want to drop and re-create it. How
would you do this without affecting the children tables? </strong></p>

<p>Disable the foreign key constraint to the parent, drop the
table, re-create the table, enable the foreign key constraint.</p>

<p><strong>13.
</strong><strong>Explain
the difference between ARCHIVELOG mode and NOARCHIVELOG mode and the benefits
and disadvantages to each. </strong></p>

<p>ARCHIVELOG mode is a mode that you can put the database in
for creating a backup of all transactions that have occurred in the database so
that you can recover to any point in time. NOARCHIVELOG mode is basically the
absence of ARCHIVELOG mode and has the disadvantage of not being able to
recover to any point in time. NOARCHIVELOG mode does have the advantage of not
having to write transactions to an archive log and thus increases the performance
of the database slightly.</p>

<p><strong>14.
</strong><strong>What
command would you use to create a backup control file? </strong></p>

<p>Alter database backup control file to trace.</p>

<p><strong>15.
</strong><strong>Give
the stages of instance startup to a usable state where normal users may access
it. </strong></p>

<p>STARTUP NOMOUNT       - Instance startup</p>

<p>STARTUP MOUNT           - The database is mounted</p>

<p>STARTUP OPEN             - The database is opened</p>

<p><strong>16.
</strong><strong>What
column differentiates the V$ views to the GV$ views and how? </strong></p>

<p>The INST_ID column which indicates the instance in a RAC
environment the information came from.</p>

<p><strong>17.
</strong><strong>How
would you go about generating an EXPLAIN plan? </strong></p>

<p>Create a plan table with utlxplan.sql. </p>

<p>Use the explain plan set statement_id = 'tst1' into plan_table
for a SQL statement</p>

<p>Look at the explain plan with utlxplp.sql or utlxpls.sql</p>

<p><strong>18.
</strong><strong>How
would you go about increasing the buffer cache hit ratio? </strong></p>

<p>Use the buffer cache advisory over a given workload and
then query the v$db_cache_advice table. If a change was necessary then I would
use the alter system set db_cache_size command.</p>

<p><strong>19.
</strong><strong>Explain
an ORA-01555 </strong></p>

<p>You get this error when you get a snapshot too old within
rollback. It can usually be solved by increasing the undo retention or
increasing the size of rollbacks. You should also look at the logic involved in
the application getting the error message.</p>

<p><strong>20.
</strong><strong>Explain
the difference between $ORACLE_HOME and $ORACLE_BASE. </strong></p>

<p>ORACLE_BASE is the root directory for oracle. ORACLE_HOME
located beneath ORACLE_BASE is where the oracle products reside.</p>

<p><strong>21.&nbsp; How would you
determine the time zone under which a database was operating? </strong></p>

<pre>select DBTIMEZONE from dual;</pre>

<p><strong>22.&nbsp;
Explain
the use of setting GLOBAL_NAMES equal to TRUE. </strong></p>

<p>Setting <strong>GLOBAL_NAMES</strong> dictates how you might connect to a database.
This variable is either TRUE or FALSE and if it is set to TRUE it enforces
database links to have the same name as the remote database to which they are
linking.</p>

<p><strong>23.&nbsp;
What
command would you use to encrypt a PL/SQL application? </strong></p>

<p>WRAP</p>

<p><strong>24.&nbsp;
Explain
the difference between a FUNCTION, PROCEDURE and PACKAGE. </strong></p>

<p>A function and procedure are the same in that they are
intended to be a collection of PL/SQL code that carries a single task. While a
procedure does not have to return any values to the calling application, a
function will return a single value. A package on the other hand is a
collection of functions and procedures that are grouped together based on their
commonality to a business function or application.</p>

<p><strong>25.&nbsp;
Explain
the use of table functions. </strong></p>

<p>Table functions are designed to return a set of rows
through PL/SQL logic but are intended to be used as a normal table or view in a
SQL statement. They are also used to pipeline information in an ETL process.</p>

<p><strong>26.&nbsp;
Name
three advisory statistics you can collect. </strong></p>

<p>Buffer Cache Advice, Segment Level Statistics, &amp; Timed
Statistics</p>

<p><strong>27.&nbsp;
Where
in the Oracle directory tree structure are audit traces placed? </strong></p>

<p>In unix $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/audit, in Windows the event
viewer</p>

<p><strong>28.&nbsp;
Explain
materialized views and how they are used. </strong></p>

<p>Materialized views are objects that are reduced sets of
information that have been summarized, grouped, or aggregated from base tables.
They are typically used in data warehouse or decision support systems.</p>

<p><strong>29.&nbsp;
When a
user process fails, what background process cleans up after it? </strong></p>

<p>PMON</p>

<p><strong>30.&nbsp;
What
background process refreshes materialized views? </strong></p>

<p>The Job Queue Processes.</p>

<p><strong>31.&nbsp;
How
would you determine what sessions are connected and what resources they are
waiting for? </strong></p>

<p>Use of V$SESSION and V$SESSION_WAIT</p>

<p><strong>32.&nbsp;
Describe
what redo logs are. </strong></p>

<p>Redo logs are logical and physical structures that are
designed to hold all the changes made to a database and are intended to aid in
the recovery of a database.</p>

<p><strong>33.&nbsp;
How
would you force a log switch? </strong></p>

<pre>ALTER SYSTEM SWITCH LOGFILE;</pre>

<p><strong>34.&nbsp;
Give
two methods you could use to determine what DDL changes have been made. </strong></p>

<p>You could use Logminer or Streams</p>

<p><strong>35.&nbsp;
What
does coalescing a tablespace do? </strong></p>

<p>Coalescing is only valid for dictionary-managed tablespaces
and de-fragments space by combining neighboring free extents into large single
extents.</p>

<p><strong>36.&nbsp;
What is
the difference between a TEMPORARY tablespace and a PERMANENT tablespace? </strong></p>

<p>A temporary tablespace is used for temporary objects such
as sort structures while permanent tablespaces are used to store those objects
meant to be used as the true objects of the database.</p>

<p><strong>37.&nbsp;
Name a
tablespace automatically created when you create a database. </strong></p>

<p>The SYSTEM tablespace.</p>

<p><strong>38.&nbsp;
When
creating a user, what permissions must you grant to allow them to connect to
the database? </strong></p>

<p>Grant the CONNECT to the user.</p>

<p><strong>39.&nbsp;
How do
you add a data file to a tablespace? </strong></p>

<pre>ALTER TABLESPACE &lt;tablespace_name&gt; ADD DATAFILE &lt;datafile_name&gt; SIZE &lt;size&gt;</pre>

<p><strong>40.&nbsp;
How do
you resize a data file? </strong></p>

<pre>ALTER DATABASE DATAFILE &lt;datafile_name&gt; RESIZE &lt;new_size&gt;;</pre>

<p><strong>41.&nbsp;
What
view would you use to look at the size of a data file? </strong></p>

<pre>DBA_DATA_FILES</pre>

<p><strong>42.&nbsp;
What
view would you use to determine free space in a tablespace? </strong></p>

<pre>DBA_FREE_SPACE</pre>

<p><strong>43.&nbsp;
How
would you determine who has added a row to a table? </strong></p>

<p>Turn on fine grain auditing for the table.</p>

<p><strong>44.&nbsp;
How can
you rebuild an index? </strong></p>

<pre>ALTER INDEX &lt;index_name&gt; REBUILD;</pre>

<p><strong>45.&nbsp;
Explain
what partitioning is and what its benefit is. </strong></p>

<p>Partitioning is a method of taking large tables and
indexes and splitting them into smaller, more manageable pieces.</p>

<p><strong>46.&nbsp;
You
have just compiled a PL/SQL package but got errors, how would you view the
errors? </strong></p>

<pre>SHOW ERRORS</pre>

<p><strong>47.&nbsp;
How can
you gather statistics on a table? </strong></p>

<p>The ANALYZE command.</p>

<p><strong>48.&nbsp;
How can
you enable a trace for a session? </strong></p>

<p>Use the DBMS_SESSION.SET_SQL_TRACE or</p>

<p>Use ALTER SESSION SET SQL_TRACE = TRUE;</p>

<p><strong>49.&nbsp;
What is
the difference between the SQL*Loader and IMPORT utilities? </strong></p>

<p>These two Oracle utilities are used for loading data into
the database. The difference is that the import utility relies on the data
being produced by another Oracle utility EXPORT while the SQL*Loader utility
allows data to be loaded that has been produced by other utilities from
different data sources just so long as it conforms to ASCII formatted or
delimited files.</p>

<p><strong>50.&nbsp;
Name
two files used for network connection to a database. </strong></p>

<p>TNSNAMES.ORA and SQLNET.ORA</p>

</div>

<hr>

<h3>Technical – UNIX</h3>

<p>Every DBA should know something about the operating system
that the database will be running on. The questions here are related to UNIX
but you should equally be able to answer questions related to common Windows environments.
</p>

<div style="margin: 20px;"><p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
How do
you list the files in an UNIX directory while also showing hidden files? </strong></p>

<pre>ls -ltra</pre>

<p><strong>2.&nbsp;
How do
you execute a UNIX command in the background? </strong></p>

<p>Use the &quot;&amp;&quot; </p>

<p><strong>3.&nbsp;
What
UNIX command will control the default file permissions when files are created? </strong></p>

<p>Umask </p>

<p><strong>4.&nbsp;
Explain
the read, write, and execute permissions on a UNIX directory. </strong></p>

<p>Read allows you to see and list the directory contents.</p>

<p>Write allows you to create, edit and delete files and
subdirectories in the directory.</p>

<p>Execute gives you the previous read/write permissions plus
allows you to change into the directory and execute programs or shells from the
directory.</p>

<p><strong>5.&nbsp;
the difference between a soft link and a hard link? </strong></p>

<p>A symbolic (soft) linked file and the targeted file can be
located on the same or different file system while for a hard link they must be
located on the same file system.</p>

<p><strong>6.&nbsp;
Give
the command to display space usage on the UNIX file system. </strong></p>

<pre>df -lk</pre>

<p><strong>7.&nbsp;
Explain
iostat, vmstat and netstat. </strong></p>

<p>Iostat reports on terminal, disk and tape I/O activity.</p>

<p>Vmstat reports on virtual memory statistics for processes,
disk, tape and CPU activity.</p>

<p>Netstat reports on the contents of network data
structures.</p>

<p><strong>8.&nbsp;
How
would you change all occurrences of a value using VI? </strong></p>

<p>Use :<code>%s/&lt;old&gt;/&lt;new&gt;/g</code></p>

<p><strong>9.&nbsp;
Give
two UNIX kernel parameters that effect an Oracle install </strong></p>

<p>SHMMAX &amp; SHMMNI</p>

<p><strong>10.&nbsp;
Briefly,
how do you install Oracle software on UNIX. </strong></p>

<p>Basically, set up disks, kernel parameters, and run orainst.</p>
