
- Automatic Storage Management (ASM)
- Leveraging the Flash Recovery Area

- The data is stored in the Automatic Workload Repository (AWR).
- AWR collects 2 types of usage metrics:
    ~ Database feature usage.
    ~ High watermark (HWM) of database attributes.
   
- Data Pump

Data Pump Interactive Commands
    add_file        - add another file to the dump file set
    continue_client - changes mode from interactive client to logging mode
    exit_client     - leaves client and discontinues logging
    kill_job        - detaches all client sessions and terminates job
    parallel        - increases or decreases the number of threads
    start_job       - starts or restarts a job (use skip_current option to
                      skip the recent failed ddl statement)
    stop_job        - stops the current job
    status          - displays the status of the job

- Cross-Platform Transportable Tablespaces
    Convert the datafiles with RMAN if the Endian formats are different.
       If they are the same skip this step.

- Managing the Scheduler

    Main differenced between dbms_job and dbms_scheduler:
    - Dbms_scheduler can execute OS executables.

- Collecting Performance Statistics
    - The Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) takes a snapshot of the
      database in specified intervals and stores it in the SYSAUX
      tablespace.
    - In 10g the performance statistics are collected automatically.
    - Components of the Common Managebility Infrastructure (CMI)
        ~ Automantic Workload Repository
        ~ Automated Tasks
        ~ Server Alerts
        ~ Advisory Framework
    - AWR doesnt contain details info about active sessions. Use the Active
      Session History (ASH) which samples v$session every second instead.

- Diagnosing Performance Statistics
    Using the Automatic Database Diagnostic Monitor (ADDM)

Automating Database Management
    - Using Automatic Shared Memory Management (ASMM)

Collecting Automatic Optimizer Statistics
-----------------------------------------
- In 10g the optimizer statistics are collected automatically.
- The automatic stale monitoring is enabled when STATISTICS_LEVEL is set to
  TYPICAL or ALL.


Identifying the Advisory Framework
----------------------------------
- Provides a uniform interface for all advisors.
- Components:
    ~ ADDM: Does top-down instance analysis.
    ~ SQL Tuning Advisor
        Takes one or more SQL statements as an input and invokes the
        Automatic Tuning Optimizer (ATO) to perform SQL tuning on the
        statements. It gives recommendations like: Creation of new indexes,
        restructuring of the SQL statement, or creation of SQL Profile.
    ~ SQL Access Advisor
        Analyzes schema and recomends indexes, mviews and mview logs.
    ~ Segment Advisor
    ~ Undo Advisor
    ~ PGA Advisor
    ~ Memory Advisor

Tablespace changes
    - sysaux tablespace
    - Bigfile Tablespaces
        have only 1 datafile that can be up to 128 terabytes (depending
        on blocksize)
    - Temporary Tablespace Groups
    - Default permanent tablespace

Procative Tablespace Monitoring
-------------------------------
- New package dbms_server_alert to set thresholds to be notified
    Warning alert level (default 85%)
    Critical alert level (default 97%)

Automatic Storage Management (ASM)
- ASM stripes files not logical volumes.
- If disks are added, ASM automatically moves files from existing disks to
  the new disk.
- ASM eliminates the need for a logical valume manager for RAC.
- New processes for ASM instances:
    RBAL: Coordinates the disk activity for disk groups.
    ORBn: Performs the extent movement between disks in the disk group 
          (n is between 0 and 9)

Understanding the SQL Tuning Advisor
====================================
The SQL Tuning Advisor invokes the Automatic Tuning Optimizer (ATO) to
perform SQL tuning.

Understanding the SQL Access Advisor
====================================
- Input sources for SQL Access Advisor:
    ~ Current SQL statements from v$sql (sql cache)
    ~ A user-specfied list of SQL statements
    ~ Name of a schema
    ~ STSs previously saved in the workload repository
- It is most benefitial in a data warehouse environment.

Leveraging the Flash Recovery Area
==================================
- The database must be in archive log mode to be flashback-enabled.
- A flash recovery area can be shared by more than one DB.
- Oracle automatically deletes files from the flash recovery area that are
  no longer needed. This will be written to the alert log.
- Fast Recovery using SWITCH DATABASE
