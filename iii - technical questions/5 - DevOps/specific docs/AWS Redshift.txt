AWS Redshift Database
=====================

1 Traditional Data Warehouse

  Top Tier (Query Reports, Analytics, Data Mining, ...)
  
  
  - Difficult to scale up or down
  - Upgrading is difficult and time/resource needs
  - Performance issues
  

2 Amazon Redshift - A to Z
--------------------------

  - Fast, scalable data warehouse
  - Parallel, column-orientated
  
  - Collection of compute resources (nodes) that are organized into groups
  - They become clusters
  - Each cluster runs an Amazon Redshift engine and contains one or more databases
  - The cluster has a leader node and one or more compute nodes
  
  - The leader node receives queries from client applications
  - It develops an execution plan 
  - It coordinates the parallel execution of these plans with one or more compute nodes
  - When the computed nodes have finished the leader node aggreates the results from
    all these nodes
  - It then sends the result back to the client application
  
  - The compute nodes are further divided into node slices
  
  - Client appliactions use JDBC (Java) or ODBC (SQL) to connect to Redshift
  
  
  Node Types
    Dense Storage (DS)
    Dense Compute (DC)
    
  Redshift
    pros:
      - Easy to set up
      - Easy to scale
      - Scale up: Increase the number of compute nodes
      - Scale down: Decrease the number of compute nodes
      - Columnar storage
      - Parallel execution
      - Cost effective
      
  Columnar storage
    - Data is stored as columns
      One block holds data of a column (e.g. student_name(1), student_name(2), ...)
          
  Traditional storage
    - Data is stored as rows
      One block hold all the data of a row (e.g. student_id, student_name, address, ...)
      ==> All IDs are stored in the first block
          All names are stored in the second block
          ...
    - Because a block contains similar data you get better data compression 
      A block can hold about 3 times the amount of data compared to row storage
      ==> You have fewer IO operations
    
    - Storing records for on field together the database can perform analysis on 
      similar type of data far quicker than row storage
    
    - Data lake. s3 storage for Redshift to store data in raw format, e.g. csv, RCF file, ...)
    
    - Amazon Redshift spectrum (interface between Redshift and Data Lake
      This enables you to directely query data stored in S3 (Data Lake) 
      without having to move the data into Redshift.
      
    - Backups into S3
    - Data encryption
        

3 Demo on Amazon Redshift
-------------------------

  1. Install SQL Drivers and Tools
    - Install SQL Workbench/J
    - Install JDBC driver
    - Make sure you have Java Runtime enabled on your OS

  2. Create a Redshift database
      
  3. Run SQL queries using the SQL Workbench
