ServiceNow has been introduced to RBS two years ago replacing the old legacy system. It is used for raising and tracking production change requests, incidents and non-production work requests. I have used ServiceNow since it's introductuion.

I was working at the MIG project which is a bespoke interface to a 3rd party application. 
A performance tuing exercise was part of the requirements. I run AWR and ASH reports to identify issues.
For identified problem SQL statements, I run the SQL tuning advisor. The resulting fixes included additional indexes and code changes.

The LoanIQ project team had a few performance issues with the batch during my time at the project. I followed the same approach by running the 
AWR report. It was ususally very clear what SQL was the problem. Most of the time it was due to plan stabliliy when the 
optimizer picked up a bad execution plan. I checked if there was a recent execution plan change for this SQL in question 
using dba_hist views, compared the plans, their run time and used sqlprofiles to get the optimizer to use the correct execution plan in future.
