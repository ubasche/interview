What do you do when you are asked to roll out new software over all the bank's clients?

- Get installation instructions from the vendor.
- Do a test installation, using the help of the supplier if possible.
- Roll out the software to a small test group, e.g. IT staff.
- Get feedback from the test group.
- If test is ok, roll out the software to the rest of the users.
